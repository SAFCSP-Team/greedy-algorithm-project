# Greedy Algorithm Project


### Objective

In this project, our objective is to understand how to use the Greedy algorithm

### Problem   

Imagine you have a truck and a list of items, you should fill the truck with the most valued items. Note that the truck capacity is only 100kg.

- Items list:
  
Item 1:   
weight: 50kg    
value: 4000$    
   
Item 2:    
weight: 30kg    
value: 3000$    
   
Item 3:    
weight: 20kg     
value: 2000$     
   
Item 3:    
weight: 10kg     
value: 1500$     
   
- Solution:
   
Using Greedy algorithm.    
1. Pick the most valuable item that will fit in your truck.
2. Pick the next most valuable item that will fit in your truck. And so on.
   
- Result:
   
Item 1:   
weight: 50kg    
value: 4000$    
   
Item 2:    
weight: 30kg    
value: 3000$    
   
Item 3:    
weight: 20kg     
value: 2000$
